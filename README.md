# What's this?
Just a holiday project with my friend Raugdae, a website that uses EmulatorJS to emulate retro games directly in the browser, all with a cool retro looking UI.

# Who's this for?
It's for us, and anyone who wants to host their own browser-based emulation platform.

# Where are the ROMs tho?
**We do not distribute ROM files.** You'll need to use your own.  
We stand firmly against piracy and encourage everyone to acquire their ROMs **legally** through proper channels.

# B... but that catchphrase then?
*"You rip 'em, we emulate 'em!"*  
It's just a joke, inspired by a [content creator](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDclfh1Oesu/) who uses witty catchphrases to deal with phone scammers. Please don’t mistake this as a suggestion that we provide ROMs—we don’t.
